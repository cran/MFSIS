#' Generate simulation data (Discrete response data based on poisson model)
#'
#' This function helps you quickly generate simulation data based on poisson model.
#' You just need to input the sample and dimension of the data
#' you want to generate and the covariance parameter pho.
#' The simulated examples based on poisson model are significant popular
#' in the screening procedures, such as Model 1.f in Liu et al.(2020).
#'
#' @param n Number of subjects in the dataset to be simulated. It will also equal to the
#' number of rows in the dataset to be simulated, because it is assumed that each
#' row represents a different independent and identically distributed subject.
#' @param p Number of predictor variables (covariates) in the simulated dataset.
#' These covariates will be the features screened by model-free procedures.
#' @param rho The correlation between adjacent covariates in the simulated matrix X.
#' The within-subject covariance matrix of X is assumed to has the same form as an
#' AR(1) auto-regressive covariance matrix, although this is not meant to imply
#' that the X covariates for each subject are in fact a time series. Instead, it is just
#' used as an example of a parsimonious but nontrivial covariance structure. If
#' rho is left at the default of zero, the X covariates will be independent and the
#' simulation will run faster.
#' @param beta A vector with length of n, which are the coefficients that you want to generate
#' about Linear model. The default is beta=(1,1,1,1,1,0,...,0)^T;
