\usage{
SIS(X, Y, nsis = (dim(X)[1])/log(dim(X)[1]))
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The design matrix of dimensions n * p. Each row is an observation vector.}

\item{Y}{The response vector of dimension n * 1.}

\item{nsis}{Number of predictors recruited by SIS. The default is n/log(n).}
}
\value{
the labels of first nsis largest active set of all predictors
}
\description{
To overcome challenges caused by ultra-high dimensionality,
Fan and Lv (2008) proposed a sure independence screening (SIS)
method, which aims to screen out the redundant features by
ranking their marginal Pearson correlations. The SIS method
is named after the SIS property, which states the selected subset
of features contains all the active ones with probability
approaching one.

\examples{

n <- 100
p <- 200
rho <- 0.5
data <- GendataLM(n, p, rho, error = "gaussian")
data <- cbind(data[[1]], data[[2]])
colnames(data)[1:ncol(data)] <- c(paste0("X", 1:(ncol(data) - 1)), "Y")
data <- as.matrix(data)
X <- data[, 1:(ncol(data) - 1)]
Y <- data[, ncol(data)]
A <- SIS(X, Y, n / log(n))
